# Position Keeper Plugin for Signal K

Position Keeper is a zero-configuration Signal K plugin that maintains vessel position reporting during GPS signal loss. It automatically stores the last known position and continues to emit location data at configurable intervals when GPS becomes unavailable. This plug-and-play solution ensures continuous operation of position-dependent systems without requiring manual setup or intervention.

## Purpose
- Maintains position data during GPS signal loss
- Stores last known position automatically
- Emits stored position on configurable intervals
- Ensures continuous position reporting even after boat GPS sources are turned off
